Problem: FizzBuzz

Every 3 minutes switch navigator => driver
First cycle only navigator speaks.
Driver can ask clarifiying questions.
Navigator should work on conveying intent, not telling the driver exactly what to do (unless skill lacks)
No one else talks.

After 1 or 2 cycles of this, add in two navigators

Eventually, everyone can talk and cycle navigators (only one converstation at a time)

Results:
Commented out code should be deleted
Why a class?
Everyone moved forward
Lowest common denominator
