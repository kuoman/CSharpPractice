PSP:
	Started Bowling, but dove into what is the first story, simplest possible to work on.


ESS:
	Started in by talking about what is a Kata.
	Asking about is the one thing we going to practice intentionally today.


Red, Green, Refactor
Steve's Kata Rules:
	1. Focus on the Intentional Practicie topic! (it's not about getting to the destination, it's about how you get there!)
	2. Simplest possible to get things to work
	3. Supporting #1, carte blanche (dirty and bad things, within reason)
	4. Working software
	5. If you've never seen a test fail, how do you know it works?  How did you ever write code to support it?

Four Rules of Simple Design
	1. Code Works, Tests pass, Working Code, passes all tests
	2. Effectively named, conveys intent, reveals intent, Clear/Expressive and consistent
	3. No Duplication, DRY, Duplicates no behavior/configuration
	4. Small, fewest elements, Minimal methods/classes/modules

Daily Format:
Code Problem: Bowling, FizzBuzz...etc
Practicing: 1 primary and maybe 1 secondary practice
Style: Individual, Pairing, Mob
